Mitochondria are essential organelles in human cells, playing pivotal roles in cellular processes such as respiration, apoptosis regulation, and lipid metabolism. Cells contain a variable number of mitochondria. The total number of copies of mtDNA per cell (mtDNA-CN) varies widely depending on multiple factors, such as age, gender and tissue. This study utilizes simulated data to explore and delineate the differences in mtDNA-CN across these diverse factors, offering insights into the complex dynamics of mitochondrial genetics.
